The system assists the doctors and nurses in the ER to decide which patient to treat next. It does so by reviewing the severity of the illness as well as the time that the patient came to the ER (order of arrival). Each patient that arrives at the hospital provides his name (first name, last name, and id) to the triage nurse. The triage nurse also assesses the patient and determines the medical problem and the priority level (i.e., how severe the medical issue is). Once accepted into the hospital the patient is tagged with an arrival order. To test program, you will need to compile and link the test program with your code. For example use gcc -g emergencyRoomMain.c linked_list_hospital.c patient.c The following bonus fucntions were created : * int releasePatients(ListNode **head, unsigned char priority); * ListNode *reverseList(ListNode *head);* void printListReverse(ListNode *head, void (*myPrint)(PatientInfo *patient)); *
